# pHluorin_ROI_selector
Select infinite number of ROIs and plot their time series profile

The original script was written by Sebastian Rhode on 26th of April 2011. I found the script published in an ImageJ forum (link: http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/Plot-profiles-of-multiple-ROI-s-on-the-same-graph-with-color-coding-for-td3684805.html). The code originally worked for up to 8 ROIs. I modified te code so it works for an infinite number of ROIs.
